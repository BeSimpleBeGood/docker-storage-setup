.SH NAME
.PP
docker\-storage\-setup - Grows the root filesystem and sets up a LVM thin pool for docker.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]docker-storage-setup\f[] 
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
None. 
.SH EXAMPLES
Run \f[B]docker-storage-setup\f[] after setting up your configuration in 
/etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup. One can look at
/usr/lib/docker-storage-setup/docker-storage-setup for various options and
their default settings. Anything user wants to change, should be changed
in /etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup. This is the file which will
override any settings specified in /usr/lib/docker-storage-setup/docker-storage-setup.

lvm2 version should be same or higher than lvm2-2.02.112 for lvm thin pool
functionality to work properly.

\f[B]Supported options for the configuration file\f[]:

DEVS: A quoted, space-separated list of devices to be used.  This
      currently expects the devices to be unpartitioned drives.  If
      "VG" is not specified, then use of the root disk's extra space
      is implied.

VG:   The volume group to use for docker storage.  Defaults to the
      volume group where the root filesystem resides.  If VG is
      specified and the volume group does not exist, it will be
      created (which requires that "DEVS" be nonempty, since we don't
      currently support putting a second partition on the root disk).

      lvm2 version should be same or higher than lvm2-2.02.112 for lvm
      thin pool functionality to work properly.

GROWPART:
      One can use this option to enable/disable growing of partition
      table backing root volume group. This is intended for virtualization
      and cloud installations. By default it is disabled. Use GROWPART=true
      to enable automatic partition table resizing.

The options below should be specified as values acceptable to 'lvextend -L':

ROOT_SIZE: The size to which the root filesystem should be grown.

DATA_SIZE: The desired size for the docker data LV.  Defaults to using
           98% free space in the VG after the root LV and docker
           metadata LV have been allocated/grown.

           DATA_SIZE can take values acceptable to "lvcreate -L" as
           well as some values acceptable to to "lvcreate -l". If user
           intends to pass values acceptable to "lvcreate -l", then
           only those values which contains "%" in syntax are
           acceptable.  If value does not contain "%" it is assumed
           value is suitable for "lvcreate -L".


\f[B]Sample\f[]

A simple, sample /etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup: 

DEVS=/dev/vdb

DATA_SIZE=8GB
